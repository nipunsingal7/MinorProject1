#TRIPLE CRYPT: HIGH DELIVERABLE PASS-CODE SYSTEM

Triple crypt as the title suggests is a cryptography system which is used to protect the data specifically passwords by using three layer of security algorithms. The entire system is built in C programming language using various functions and libraries of the C. The main idea of creating this system is to provide a high level security to the weak passwords, as such weak passwords are easy to crack and their hashes are easily available on the internet.A salt is simply added to make a password hash output unique even for users adopting common passwords. 
In this system the password will undergo three layers of protection- encryption, salting and hashing.

Objectives- 
1)To provide security to secure easy to crack data
2)To provide the opportunity of using simple passwords
3)To provide triple layer security

System requirements-
OS: Windows XP/7/8/10
CPU: Intel Core i3 @ 2.30GHz  processor
RAM: 1 GB
Video card: 256 or 512 MB
C compiler
